    <p>This dish was made with the purpose of simulating meat without having acces to it</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>6 white potatoes.</li>
        <li>3 Eringi mushrooms</li>
        <li>1 large white onion, or 2 medium white onions.</li>
        <li>1 sprig of rosemary.</li>
        <li>Butter. I suggest 2 tablespoons (30ml), but you could always used a bit more.</li>
        <li>2 packs of thick-cut bacon.</li>
        <li>1 cup, or 250ml of red wine. We used a Pinot Noir since its preferable for cooking.</li>
        <li>1/4 cup, or 60ml of sake. Any sake that is labeled as “sweet” should do.</li>
        <li>2 tbs, or 30ml of soy sauce.</li>
        <li>1 spring of parsley or any garnish.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Peel</strong> the potatos.</li>
        <li><strong>Slice</strong> the potatoes into quarters or halves.</li>
        <li><strong>Chop</strong> the mushrooms and onions into equally-sized small cubes (5-6cm).</li>
        <li><strong>Steam</strong> the potatoes until soft (about 15-20 minutes).</li>
        <li><strong>Pan Fry</strong> the onions and mushrooms until caramelized or fully golden.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Prep the pan with a tablespoon of butter.</li>
        </ul>

        <li><strong>Mash</strong> the potatoes into small chunks in a large bowl.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine</strong> the onion and mushroom mix with the potato mash.</li>
        <li><strong>Pick</strong> the rosemary off its stem.</li>
        <li><strong>Add</strong> the salt to the top of the bowl.</li>
        <li><strong>Form</strong> the fake roast.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Let the mix cool until touchable (more than 5 minutes). CAUTION HOT</li>
            <li>Take all of the mix and form it into a log shape.</li>
        </ul>

        <li><strong>Wrap</strong> the roast in bacon.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Wrap the roast fully, try not to leave any gaps, otherwise, the potatoes will seep out when the bacon tightens.</li>
            <li>There is no surefire way of doing this, just coat it to the best of your ability.</li>
        </ul>

        <li><strong>Tie</strong> the roast with the twine. It doesn't need to be anything fancy, just wrap it around a few times</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Intertwine the rosemary afterward.</li>
        </ul>

        <li><strong>Bake</strong> in the oven.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Bake at 375ºF or 190ºC for 30-45 minutes or until bacon is golden (cook longer for crispy bacon), turning halfway.</li>
        </ul>

        <li><strong>Boil</strong> the wine in the frying pan</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Bring the wine to a boil (~10 minutes) on medium-high heat in a frying pan. The aim is to reduce it. </li>
        </ul>
        
        <li><strong>Add</strong> the butter, sake and soy sauce to the wine</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Amount: 1 tbs of butter, 1/4 cup of sake, 2 tbs of soy sauce.</li>
            <li>Melt the butter into the boiling wine.</li>
            <li>Pour the soy sauce and sake into the sauce.</li>
            <li>Continue to cook for 2-3 minutes. </li>
        </ul>

        <li><strong>Remove</strong> the twine and the rosemary when the baking is done. <strong>They are not to be eaten.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Pour</strong> the finished sauce onto the roast (make sure the roast is on a plate to hold the extra sauce). Pour slowly.</li>
        <li><strong>Add</strong>  garnish to the top of the dish, we used parsley, the anime used watercress. </li>
    </ol>
